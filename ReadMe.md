# GreekTyper

(Julia/Dash edition)

This web-app allows users to type ancient polytonic Greek using only ASCII characters. The app will transliterate this into proper, Unicode Greek, which may then be copied and pasted elsewhere.

The scheme for typing Greek in ASCII is *Beta Code*. It dates back to the 1970s and the earliest projects to work with Greek computationally.
